front end steps:

	Clone the github repo: https://github.com/pem2k/cs_5002_final_front_end/

	install npm cli tool from: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

	Navigate to front end directory

	run "npm install" without quotes, dependencies will install from package.json

	run npm start - the app will open your browser and will run on localhost:3000

Backend Steps:

	Clone the github repo: https://github.com/pem2k/cs5002_final_backend

	in terminal, navigate to the project directory

	create a virtual environment by typing the below in your console without quotes:
		windows: "python -m venv venv"
		Mac: "python3 -m venv venv"

	Activate your virtual env by running the below without quotes:
		windows:"venv/scripts/activate"
		mac: "source venv/bin/activate

	You are now in your virtual environment, run pip install -r requirements.txt

	once complete:
		Windows: venv/scripts/python.exe main.py
		mac: python3 main.py
	
	The app may ask you y/n to see if you want to run it on another port since 3000 is taken, it should automatically select port:5000.

	If it chooses a different port, no worries, navigate to the front end, in the front end directory, find src/components/inverseform.jsx. On line 24, swap the port in the 	url item in the axios request shown below:
	
	 axios({
            method: "post",
            url: "http://localhost:5000/",
            data: userSubmission
        }).then(response => {
            console.log(response.data.works)

            if (typeof response.data.works ==="string"){
                setSteps([response.data.works])
            }
            else{
                setSteps(response.data.works)
            }
            
       }).catch(error=> console.error("error:", error))
    }

Note - python3 should work as is on mac, if it doesnt let me know, we likely have to swap the interpreter we're using or directly target a specific interpreter with our start command
