Notes:

Arsh:
- Do not dwell too long on any item
- Video script should be made as we work along
- Maybe test - I guess we can do some of the linear encoding by hand or from the existing 
- 12 pages (~6000 words) but time.
- Most important metric is time.
- Bibliography is important.
- Go over the rubric and work backwards.

Parker:

- Front-end heavy work is that within scope: some projects may be loosely connected to the course, but it is okay to explore. Programming heavy is good enough. Think about hours put in. If you like something, dig-in to that, it is fine.

Oksana:

- Bibliography - not necessary, but reference like. If you are doing something completely new then necessary, else not. Making it in formal style is important so that these can be found. Inline and reference section.
