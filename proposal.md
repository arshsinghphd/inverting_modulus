### Project Brief



---
The project proposal should contain the following information:

* The name and Northeastern emails of all group members
* The title of the project
* The type of project
* A paragraph or two explaining, at a high level, the motivation and goals of the project
* A high-level framework as to how you will investigate and proceed with the project
* A breakdown of expected distribution of major tasks/topics across group members
* One member of the group must email your group's project proposal to me by the deadline
accompanied by a direct message via Teams to alert me of the submission. All other group
members must be cc’d. Your proposal will be replied to in around 24 to 48 hours, even if
submitted weeks before the deadline. Thus, the earlier a group submits the proposal the earlier you will receive feedback. 

The project proposal is not expected to be perfect, but should show some thought and
effort to make an interesting project, of a scope reasonable for 2 full weeks of serious group effort, and with some initial ideas as to how your group will proceed (such as by what time certain checkpoints will be reached and who is primarily responsible for what portion of the project). Reading these project proposals gives me the opportunity to reach out to you and your group mates sooner rather than later so I may assist you in refining things such as the scope of the project (which may be too small to receive full credit or too large to be completed). 

While I do not have a fixed list of types of project, I provide some examples of project
“types” here:
● Topic Investigation: Collaboratively investigate some concept beyond the base scope
of the course and express your group's understanding of it, potential applications of it,
and how it both builds and expands upon what you learned in the course.
● Educational Resource: Write a resource to introduce and teach a topic from the
course, providing the basic introduction, an intuitive walkthrough with examples,
exercises with clearly stated purposes as to their value for the students, answer keys,
etc.
● Practical: Finding a practical application for some of the more mathematical/theoretical
content of this course, investigating this application, implementing an algorithm based on
this investigation (or several algorithms and doing benchmarking), and reporting on
various performance results, implementation pitfalls for future users to be wary of, etc.
● Original Research: Focus on a singular use case or topic and try to solve a novel
problem within this space. An example would be improving on a known algorithm in
some environment, providing a theoretical framework for understanding some topic,
writing a novel algorithm for a problem and systematically testing its performance, etc.
